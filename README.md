# gwt-universal

Render your web application server-side and client-side. For client-side rendering, the application will be compiled with [gwt](https://github.com/gwtproject/gwt). The rendering uses [jsinterop](https://github.com/google/jsinterop-base) and [elemental2](https://github.com/google/elemental2). For server-side rendering in a standard Java application server [JSoup](https://github.com/jhy/jsoup) is used, the common interface based on elemental2.
